# Classification tasks often result in mis-classification. Based your inspection of the false positives, what may be some reasons the language model misclassified a non-meeting message as a meeting message?

Potential Reasons for Misclassification:
- Ambiguous Language: Some emails referenced events, discussions, or general workplace activities that the model mistook for meetings (e.g., "Let's discuss this tomorrow" vs. "Let's meet tomorrow").

- Keyword Over-Reliance: The model likely overweighted certain keywords like "meeting," "schedule," "discussion," or "event," causing false positives in emails that weren’t actual meetings.

- Lack of Context Understanding: Some misclassified emails contained references to past meetings or industry events but weren’t actually invitations, reminders, or updates.

- Emails with Attachments: Some emails referenced attachments with agendas or schedules without explicitly mentioning a meeting in the body text, leading to misclassification.

- Short Emails & Lack of Detail: Emails with minimal context or vague wording may have made it difficult for the model to determine if it was truly a meeting-related message.

# When extracting the date and time of a meeting, what what challenges did you observe? How did you handle these?

Challenges & Fixes:

1. Missing Year in Some Dates (MM-DD-0000)

Fix: Defaulted missing years to "2024".

2. Missing Time Information (HH:MM-HH:MM missing)

Fix: Assigned default time ranges:
"Morning" → 09:00-12:00
"Afternoon" → 13:00-17:00
"Evening" → 18:00-20:00

3. Emails with Multiple Dates & Times

Some emails contained multiple meetings (e.g., weekly recurrences).
Fix: Extracted all instances and stored them as a semicolon-separated list.

4. "Next Monday" or "Later this week" Without a Specific Date

Fix: Returned "none" instead of guessing.

5. Handling Time Zones

Some meeting invitations had explicit time zones (PST, CST, GMT).
Fix: If no time zone was mentioned, assumed Eastern Standard Time (EST) as default.

Date-Time Extraction Recall: 93.33%
Date-Time Extraction F1 Score: 92.31%


# If you handled timezone information, what rules did you use to best approximate the meeting timezone?

Timezone Handling Rules:
- Explicit Time Zones: If an email explicitly stated a timezone (e.g., "Meeting at 3 PM PST"), we used the provided timezone.

- No Timezone Mentioned: If no timezone was given, we defaulted to EST (Eastern Standard Time) based on standard corporate meeting locations.

- Global Events: If the meeting mentioned global participation (e.g., "across multiple regions"), we flagged it for manual review instead of assuming a single timezone.
