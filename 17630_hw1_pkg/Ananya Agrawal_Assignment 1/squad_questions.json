{"context": "Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night and has long been associated with control of the sleep wake cycle. As a dietary supplement, it is often used for the short-term treatment of insomnia, such as from jet lag or shift work, and is typically taken orally. Evidence of its benefit for treating insomnia is unclear, as studies have generally been of low quality. It is also used for children with autism spectrum disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Melatonin is found in animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Levels of melatonin are influenced by the detection of light and darkness by the retina of the eye.", "qas": [{"question": "What gland releases melatonin, and when is it released?", "answers": [{"text": "The pineal gland releases melatonin, primarily at night.", "start_char": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "For what purpose is melatonin often used as a dietary supplement?", "answers": [{"text": "Melatonin is often used as a dietary supplement for the short-term treatment of insomnia caused by jet lag or shift work.", "start_char": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is melatonin typically taken as a supplement?", "answers": [{"text": "Melatonin is typically taken orally as a supplement.", "start_char": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What influences the levels of melatonin in the body?", "answers": [{"text": "The levels of melatonin are influenced by the detection of light and darkness by the retina of the eye.", "start_char": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which living organisms is melatonin found?", "answers": [{"text": "Melatonin is found in animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria.", "start_char": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who discovered the role of melatonin in sleep regulation?", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "What are the exact mechanisms by which melatonin affects children with autism spectrum disorders?", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "What is the chemical formula of melatonin?", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "Which country has the highest production of melatonin supplements?", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "How does melatonin interact with the body circadian rhythm at the molecular level?", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}]}
